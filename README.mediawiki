==Abstract==

This BIP-to-be proposes a new standard for merged mining, consisting of the
format of data included in the parent chain's coinbase transaction, the format
of an auxiliary proof-of-work, and procedures to generate and validate these
proofs.

==Motivation==

As it stands, the current implementation of merged mining (hereby refered to
as MM1) requires the entire relevant coinbase transaction from the parent
chain to be contained within the auxiliary proof-of-work.
In addition, MM1's method of ensuring uniqueness of auxiliary proof-of-works
is complex and space-inefficient due to flaws in its merkle tree slot
selection algorithm.

This MM2 specification produces markedly shorter auxiliary proof-of-works,
making applications such as P2Pool possible, while reducing the burden on
auxiliary blockchains.

==Specification==

H(x) is the standard double-SHA-256 hash function used by Bitcoin.
Ha(x) and Hb(s, y) are defined such that Hb(Ha(x), y) = H(x || y), with Ha(x)
producing an SHA-256 midstate augmented with the number of blocks processed
and less than a block-length of unprocessed data, and Hb(s, x) finalizing the
SHA-256 hash of the data compressed into s concatenated with x, and then
hashing it again to yield x || y's double-SHA-256 hash.

Ensuring a 1-to-1 mapping from a (parent proof-of-work, unique identifier)
pair to an auxiliary proof-of-work is important in many situations because it
prevents an unbounded number of auxiliary data hashes having an auxiliary
proof-of-work created from one parent proof-of-work.

(need a better name for uniqueness/1-to-1ness...)

Auxiliary data hash (e.g. auxiliary block hash)
Parent ref hash = 
Parent coinbase transaction hash
Parent merkle root = 
Parent block hash = H(min_header with Parent merkle root inserted)
